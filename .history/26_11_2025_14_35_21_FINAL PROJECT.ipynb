    "A UBC Computer Science research group, led by Frank Wood, is collecting data on how people play video games using a Minecraft server that tracks players’ actions. The team must carefully manage recruitment and resources, such as server capacity and software licenses, to handle the number of participants effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The broad question posed is which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team's specific question is can player characteristics (experience and age) predict total hours played in the player dataset? This question addresses our broader question by helping us discover what kinds of players are playing the most (demographically) under the assumption that more hours correspond to more sessions and, consequently, a larger contribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Player data has 196 observations and 7 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two numerical:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + played_hours: total hours played by a player\n",
    "  + Age: age of player\n",
    "\n",
    "Four character:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + experience: level of the player (\"Beginner\", \"Amateur\", \"Regular\", \"Veteran\", \"Pro\")\n",
    "  + hashedEmail: anonymized email for privacy.\n",
    "  + name: player's first name\n",
    "  + gender: player's gender\n",
    "\n",
    "One logical:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + subscribe: whether the player is subscribed to game-related newsletter\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "To address our research question, we will use K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classification to evaluate how well experience and age predict played hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we convert played_hours into a factor with categories Low, Medium, and High activity. The experience variable is mapped to a 1–5 numeric scale. Both predictors are then standardized, and any remaining NA values are removed. Finally, the KNN classification algorithm is applied to the cleaned and prepared dataset."
