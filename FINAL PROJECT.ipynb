    "A UBC Computer Science research group, led by Frank Wood, is collecting data on how people play video games using a custom Minecraft server that records detailed player actions. Understanding player behaviour and activity levels is valuable both for research and for broader applications in the gaming industry. In particular, identifying which players tend to engage more heavily with a game can support targeted recruitment, improved study design, and more effective strategies for maintaining long-term engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to answer the following question: Can player characteristics, specifically experience level and age, predict the total hours a player has spent on the Minecraft server? Our goal is to determine whether these two easily collected features can distinguish between players with low, moderate, and high activity levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of the players data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Player data has 196 observations and 7 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two numerical:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + played_hours: total hours played by an individual \n",
    "  + Age: age of player\n",
    "\n",
    "Four character:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + experience: level of the player (\"Beginner\", \"Amateur\", \"Regular\", \"Veteran\", \"Pro\")\n",
    "  + hashedEmail: anonymized email for privacy.\n",
    "  + name: player's first name\n",
    "  + gender: player's gender\n",
    "\n",
    "One logical:\n",
    "\n",
    "  + subscribe: whether the player is subscribed to game-related newsletter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the predictive analysis, we will focus on two key predictors: experience (which is converted to a 1-5 numeric scale) and age, to examine whether these characteristics relate to a player’s activity level. To model this relationship, we will use the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm, which is suitable for our analysis due to its ability to capture nonlinear patterns in data and its suitability for smaller datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal number of neighbours, k, will be selected using 5-fold cross-validation, with performance evaluated via accuracy and confusion matrices. This approach will allow us to assess whether simple demographic and experience-based features can meaningfully predict how active a player is, helping identify which types of players are most likely to contribute large amounts of gameplay data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thesis: We expect that both age and prior experience will meaningfully predict player activity levels, with these two features helping distinguish between players who contribute low, moderate, and high amounts of gameplay data."

    "#### Summary of Findings.\n",
    "Even after rebalancing the played-hours categories by creating a separate None group and spreading the remaining players into Low, Medium, and High, the KNN model still predicted almost exclusively the majority classes. The confusion matrix showed that nearly all predictions fell into None or Low, with no correct predictions for Medium or High. Model metrics confirmed this pattern: the best model achieved an accuracy of 0.306, precision of 0.312, and recall of only 0.184, displaying consistently poor performance for minority categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Whether This Was Expected.\n",
    "These results are aligned with what we would expect based on the initial summary statistics, which already showed a major skew toward players with very low or no played hours. From the beginning, the dataset contained far fewer Medium and High players, and age and experience showed weak separation across these groups. Given this imbalance and lack of distinct patterns, it was predictable that KNN would struggle, especially with recall, despite attempts to rebalance the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact of These Findings.\n",
    "For the research group’s recruitment strategy, these findings suggest that age and experience are not useful indicators for identifying high-engagement players. Relying on these characteristics would not help target participants who contribute substantial gameplay data. This highlights the need for more informative predictors, such as in-game behavior, play frequency, or indicators of player motivation, to better identify high-data participants.\n",
